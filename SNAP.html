            <h3>Introduction to SNAP (demonstarted with a number of projects)</h3>
            <p>This report demonstrates the use of remotely sensed images both radar and optical being Sentinel 1
                and Sentinel 2 respectively in analyzing Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and
                multi-temporal analysis. NDMI has many applications including crop water stress monitoring. The
                preprocessing and analysis tasks undertaken in this report were done with Sentinel Application
                Platform (SNAP) software and supported with QGIS for creating maps of the results. Images were
                acquired from Copernicus Open Access Hub. The report is structured to focus on capturing
                important metadata characteristics, workflow which includes image acquisition, image preprocessing, analysis, and presenting map output as well as interpreting them. For the purpose of clarity and ease
                of understanding, the general workflow is summarized in a diagram whiles details of the procedure is
                segmented to reflect the task being undertaken and documented a such. These are aimed at achieving
                the following main objectives
                (i) To calculate Normalized Difference Moisture index (NDMI)
                (ii) To estimate the change of NDMI (change detection)
                (iii) To create a SAR multi-temporal composite</p>

            <h4>Image Acquisition</h4>
            <p> Sentinel 2 image with processing level 2A covering
the southwestern part of Germany (study area) was used leading to achievement of objective (i) and
(ii). The image was downloaded from Copernicus Access Hub and displayed in SNAP in RGB
Sentinel MSI natural colour bands where Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B) band channels corresponds to
band 4, band 3 and band 2 of image. The result is depicted as follows,

                    The image characteristics was viewed from the metadata particularly from the General info folder. The cloud coverage assessment of the image was 6.36 and the acquisition date was 20
                    th April 2018
                    (2018-04-20). Also, the sensing orbit direction was descending and image has a processing level of
                    2A. These information are displayed below.</p>

               <h4> Preprocessing of Sentinel 2 image of study area</h4>
<p>With image processing level of 2A implying image was downloaded already atmospherically
corrected, atmospheric correction process was skipped and cloud masking undertaken to remove
clouds on the image. Clouds masking involves ‘replacing the reported reflectance values in clouded
or shadowed areas of the images with Not Available (NA) values’ (Masiliūnas, 2017). This is aimed
at reducing the noise impact of clouds on the image. Resampling was also undertaken to resize the
pixels into the same pixel size which is 10 meters (m) spatial resolution. This was done because
NDMI uses the Near Infrared (NIR) band which is band 8 with a spatial resolution of 10m which is
different from the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) which is band 11 with a spatial resolution of 60m.

            <div>
                <h4>Analysis of image (NDMI and change detection)</h4>
<p>The NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) is computed as the comparison of difference
between the NIR and SWIR, and the sum of NIR and SWIR. 
<div>
    <h4>Mathematically expressed as;</h4>
    <div class="fig-img">
        <img src="NDMI cal.jpg" class="fig-img2">            
    </div>       
</div>

Typically, NDMI values ranges from -1 to 1 with higher positive values indicating higher moisture
content of vegetation and lower positive values indicating vegetation with water stress. Negative
values of NDMI indicates non-vegetated land cover. NDMI is also used to explain land cover change
overtime hence change detection. Change detection in this report involved recognizing a variation in
NDMI values of the study area during different times. This was calculated to reflect the impact of a
change in prevailing conditions such as weather on land surface characteristics. The characteristics of
land as depicted by an image is best explain by the NDMI range of values for which a threshold is set
to delineate regions of high moisture in vegetation. Change detection in NDMI was focused on the
regions of high moisture vegetation to map changes in moisture level resulting from seasonal
changes. Workflow for preprocessing and analysis of the image is diagrammatically summarized
below;</p>

<p>Depicted in the map is the spatial distribution of NDMI values in the study area. The result is a wide
range NDMI value indicating both vegetated and non-vegetated land cover. Basically, using the
compass direction illustrated on the map, NDMI values within the range of -0.678 to -0.118 occurred
in greater proportion in the far west region of the study area as compared to other regions. Thus, the
western region of the study area is made of land cover with barely any vegetation and water stressed. Higher NDMI values (0.428 to 0.913) indicating vegetation with relatively high moisture content
was more prevalent in central region of the area as opposed to NDMI values of -0.118 to 0.128 in the
extreme east of the study area. In general, the study area is largely covered by surfaces with NDMI
values between 0.128 to 0.428 indicative of some vegetative cover with relatively low water content. The interpretation of NDMI is deduced from data provided by Antognelli (2019) which is captured
in the appendix. The segment of the image with white colour visualization are masked out clouds
which are replaced with ‘No data’ (NaN)</p>

<p>The result has a maximum NDMI value of 0.967 and minimum NDMI value of -0.999 which
corresponds to very dense vegetation with high water content and bare land with no water
respectively. This interpretation is based on index provided by Antognelli (2019) which is attached
in appendix. This result was overlay with basemap of Bing aerial with label in QGIS and visual
inspection indicates that areas with NDMI of 0.428 to 0.967 perfectly corresponds with dense
vegetated areas. These areas run vertically across the the middle section of the study area. All areas
with negative NDMI corresponded with non-vegetated areas which were verified from 2018
CORINE Land Cover dataset to be discontinuous urban fabric, continuous urban fabric among others. This dataset was obtained from Copernicus Land Monitoring Service mainly for validation purposes. Relatively low positive NDMI values of 0.128 to 0.428 can be deduced to have low vegetation with
high water stress conditions deduced from the interpretation matrix by Antognelli (2019). To delineate areas of vegetation with high moisture content ,a threshold of 0.5 was applied and the
result used to create map in QGIS as presented below.</p>

                <h4>Procedure for estimating NDMI change</h4>
                <p>
                    
To estimate the change of NDMI, vegetative index differencing method was used for high moisture
vegetation areas which is delineated with a threshold of 0.5. This method involved the subtraction of
NDMI of high moisture vegetation image for 2018-04-20 from NDMI of high moisture vegetation
for 2018-10-12 to detect changes in NDMI. Thus, all changes to be discuss and indicated are
occurring over areas of high vegetation cover. To undertake such analysis, collocation is done to combine both NDMI bands together in a common
folder. Collocation was undertaken by clicking on Raster tool on the menu bar , then navigating to
Geometic operations and clicking on Collocate. In the Collocation box, the first preprocessed image
which is dated 2018-04-20 was set as the master image and the second preprocessed image set as the
slave image in a procedure visualized in the workflow below.

                    <h4>Interpretation of NDMI change</h4>
                    <p>
                        Analyzing the changes in NDMI between the period of April and October for high moisture
                        vegetation, the minimum NDMI change was -0.399 (0.4) and maximum was 0.284 (0.3) as computed
                        from statistics. It can be interpreted that negative NDMI are areas where vegetation lost it water
                        content or increase water stress level and positive NDMI being net gain in moisture level by the
                        vegetation. Thus, the highest lost of moisture by vegetation occurred at areas with -0.4 NDMI change
                        and the highest gain in moisture by vegetation occurred in areas with 0.3 NDMI change. With such a
                        short timelaspe between images and relatively limited range of change, the proposed most plausible
                        cause of change in NDMI is seasonal changes where April image is under the Spring weather
                        condition which changes to Autumn for the October image. The spatial distribution of changes in NDMI is such that moderate loss in moisture (-0.2 to 0.0)
                        occurs more extensively in the south western part of the study area and much lesser in the south
                        eastern part. Further, greater area of vegetation in the western part of the central belt of the study area had an increase in its moisture content (0 to 0.3 NDMI change). Differences in the amount of
                        moisture lost or gain is likely to be contributed by the varying forest and vegetation on the landscape
                        ranging from broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest to mixed forest as verified from 2018 CORINE
                        land cover.</p>

            <div>
                <p> 
                    Multitemporal composite analysis involves combining images of different timestep to detect changes
                    evident in a study area over time period under study. This analysis is quite simple and efficient in
                    depicting both unchanged and change areas of phenomena being studied. This analysis is aimed at
                    achieving the third objective set in this report.

                <h4>Image acquisition of Sentinel 1 images</h4>
<p>Radar images from Sentinel 1 were used for this type of analysis. Three images of different time
steps of the same study area which was selected to be the region of Mekong Delta were used. These
images not only reflects different conditions of the study area at different times but also different
land use activities in the area. The selection of dates for the image was based on the supposed
periods for land preparation, planting and harvesting of rice in certain towns such as Mua. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that different areas undertake different activities at different times. The main phenomena that is being researched with multitemporal composite analysis is land use
changes depicting the growth stage of rice cultivation in the Mekong Delta region. To undertake a multitemporal composite, a radar sensed image being sentinel 1 Ground Range
Detector in Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode was used. Three timesteps being 13
th March 2018, 16
th August 2018 and 7
th January 2019 image covering the Mekong delta were download from
Copernicus Access Hub. The first timestep image of 13
th March 2018 is displayed in figure 2.6
which is viewed in the Amplitude band in VH polarization. Sentinel 1 images requires preprocessing
analysis which are different from optical images of Sentinel 2 which are describe below.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Preprocessing analysis of Sentinel 1 images</h4>
<p>Preprocessing of the image began with image calibration which was done to convert pixel values of
image to correspond with backscatter of the surface. For this exercise, the importance of calibration
lies in comparing images of different times. Also, Speckle filtering was undertaken to improve image
interpretation and visualization. Speckle is a “salt and pepper” effect inherent in radar images
(Held et al, 2003). Further, terrain correction was undertaken to correct geometric distortions. These
preprocessing analysis were repeated for all images of different timesteps. Prior to Multitemporal
composite analysis of image, the preprocessed images were converted to decibels in logarithmic
scale to improve visualization and stacked together.

Multitemporal composite analysis was applied on the preprocessed images by combining the images
in RGB band channels to detect changes that have occurred during the time periods analyzed. This
produced a multitude of different colours indicating diverse changes mapped. With the aim of only
detecting changes in land use with this methodology, the result was not further classified but
interpreted to reveal the spatial distribution of the changes. The complete workflow involved in
practicing multitemporal composite is illustrated below

The second and third timestep image which were sensed on 16
th August 2018 and 7
th January 2019 respectively preprocessed using the same procedure discussed for the first
timestep image. The most important issue is to make sure the second image covers the same study area.

To combine all preprocessed timestep images into a single file, the preprocessed images were
stacked. To stack images, Radar button on the menu bar was clicked, navigated to Coregisteration in
the dialog box that opened and then to Stack Tools. This was followed by clicking on Create stack. In the Create Stack box, click on the plus sign to import all image files to be stack. The minus sign
can be used to remove any file not to be stack. Create stack button was clicked and preferred settings
made. For this exercise, Product Geolocation was selected for Initial Offset Method. Run button was
clicked to execute stacking. The workflow is illustrated in the diagram below for clarity.

                                    The multitemporal colour composite of images covering the time periods of 13
th March 2018, 16th April 2018 and 7th January 2019 created depicts changes in the backscattering coefficients of land
cover and land use such as rice cultivation in the region of Mekong delta. The time-steps indicates
the rice growing seasons including harvesting which varies across the Mekong delta. Corresponding
to the chosen dates, Mua which is a rice growing community in Mekong undertakes planting in
August and harvesting in January (Liew et al, 1997). The map of multitemporal composite illustrates great variation in colour which corresponds to the
large variety of rice cropping system, different growing season and variety of rice planted in the
Mekong delta region as argued by Xuan (1975) and Liew et al, (1997). The grey areas indicate
unchanged areas with relatively constant backscattering coefficient over the time covered. These
areas are expected to be non-rice growing areas with relatively more permanent land cover during
the timesteps considered. Such areas include inland melaleuca forests, the coastal mangrove forests
where there is no significant change in the land cover compared to rice cultivation fields that have
changed with farming activities within the short period studied. Grey areas which appear to be linear
are linear settlements and roads which had relatively constant backscattering during the period (Liew
et al, 1997).
