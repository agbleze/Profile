            <h3>Multi-temporal composite analysis with SNAP </h3>
            <p>This report demonstrates the use of remotely sensed images both radar and optical being Sentinel 1
                and Sentinel 2 respectively in analyzing Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and
                multi-temporal analysis. NDMI has many applications including crop water stress monitoring. The
                preprocessing and analysis tasks undertaken in this report were done with Sentinel Application
                Platform (SNAP) software and supported with QGIS for creating maps of the results. Images were
                acquired from Copernicus Open Access Hub. The report is structured to focus on capturing
                important metadata characteristics, workflow which includes image acquisition, image preprocessing, analysis, and presenting map output as well as interpreting them. For the purpose of clarity and ease
                of understanding, the general workflow is summarized in a diagram whiles details of the procedure is
                segmented to reflect the task being undertaken and documented a such. These are aimed at achieving
                the following main objectives
                (i) To calculate Normalized Difference Moisture index (NDMI)
                (ii) To estimate the change of NDMI (change detection)
                (iii) To create a SAR multi-temporal composite

            <h4>Image Acquisition</h4>
            <p> Sentinel 2 image with processing level 2A covering the southwestern part of Germany 
                (study area) was used leading to achievement of objective (i) and (ii). The image was 
                downloaded from Copernicus Access Hub and displayed in SNAP in RGB Sentinel MSI natural 
                colour bands where Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B) band channels corresponds to band 4, band 3
                 and band 2 of image. The result is depicted as follows,

                    The image characteristics was viewed from the metadata particularly from the General 
                    info folder. The cloud coverage assessment of the image was 6.36 and the acquisition 
                    date was 20th April 2018 (2018-04-20). Also, the sensing orbit direction was descending 
                    and image has a processing level of 2A. These information are displayed below.

                <h4> Preprocessing of Sentinel 2 image of study area</h4>
                <p>With image processing level of 2A implying image was downloaded already atmospherically
                    corrected, atmospheric correction process was skipped and cloud masking undertaken to remove
                    clouds on the image. Clouds masking involves ‘replacing the reported reflectance values in 
                    clouded or shadowed areas of the images with Not Available (NA) values’ (Masiliūnas, 2017). 
                    This is aimed at reducing the noise impact of clouds on the image. Resampling was also 
                    undertaken to resize the pixels into the same pixel size which is 10 meters (m) spatial 
                    resolution. This was done because NDMI uses the Near Infrared (NIR) band which is band 8 with 
                    a spatial resolution of 10m which is different from the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) which is 
                    band 11 with a spatial resolution of 60m.

                <h4>Analysis of image (NDMI and change detection)</h4>
                <p>The NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) is computed as the comparison of difference
                    between the NIR and SWIR, and the sum of NIR and SWIR.

        <div>
            <p>
                Typically, NDMI values ranges from -1 to 1 with higher positive values indicating higher moisture
                content of vegetation and lower positive values indicating vegetation with water stress. Negative
                values of NDMI indicates non-vegetated land cover. NDMI is also used to explain land cover change
                overtime hence change detection. Change detection in this report involved recognizing a variation in
                NDMI values of the study area during different times. This was calculated to reflect the impact of a
                change in prevailing conditions such as weather on land surface characteristics. The characteristics of
                land as depicted by an image is best explain by the NDMI range of values for which a threshold is set
                to delineate regions of high moisture in vegetation. Change detection in NDMI was focused on the
                regions of high moisture vegetation to map changes in moisture level resulting from seasonal
                changes. Workflow for preprocessing and analysis of the image is diagrammatically summarized
                below;

                            <h4>Interpretation NDMI result (2018-04-20)</h4>
                            <p>Depicted in the map is the spatial distribution of NDMI values in the study area. 
                                The result is a wide range NDMI value indicating both vegetated and non-vegetated 
                                land cover. Basically, using the compass direction illustrated on the map, NDMI 
                                values within the range of -0.678 to -0.118 occurred in greater proportion in the 
                                far west region of the study area as compared to other regions. Thus, the western 
                                region of the study area is made of land cover with barely any vegetation and water 
                                stressed. Higher NDMI values (0.428 to 0.913) indicating vegetation with relatively 
                                high moisture content was more prevalent in central region of the area as opposed 
                                to NDMI values of -0.118 to 0.128 in the extreme east of the study area. 
                                In general, the study area is largely covered by surfaces with NDMI values 
                                between 0.128 to 0.428 indicative of some vegetative cover with relatively low 
                                water content. The interpretation of NDMI is deduced from data provided by 
                                Antognelli (2019) which is captured in the appendix. The segment of the image with 
                                white colour visualization are masked out clouds which are replaced with ‘No data’ (NaN)

                <h4>Procedure for estimating NDMI change</h4>
                <p>
                    To estimate the change of NDMI, vegetative index differencing method was used for high moisture
                    vegetation areas which is delineated with a threshold of 0.5. This method involved the 
                    subtraction of NDMI of high moisture vegetation image for 2018-04-20 from NDMI of high moisture
                    vegetation for 2018-10-12 to detect changes in NDMI. Thus, all changes to be discuss and 
                    indicated are occurring over areas of high vegetation cover. To undertake such analysis, 
                    collocation is done to combine both NDMI bands together in a common folder. Collocation 
                    was undertaken by clicking on Raster tool on the menu bar , then navigating to Geometic 
                    operations and clicking on Collocate. In the Collocation box, the first preprocessed image
                    which is dated 2018-04-20 was set as the master image and the second preprocessed image set as
                    the slave image in a procedure visualized in the workflow below.

                    <h4>Interpretation of NDMI change</h4>
                    <p>
                        Analyzing the changes in NDMI between the period of April and October for high moisture
                        vegetation, the minimum NDMI change was -0.399 (0.4) and maximum was 0.284 (0.3) as 
                        computed from statistics. It can be interpreted that negative NDMI are areas where 
                        vegetation lost it water content or increase water stress level and positive NDMI being 
                        net gain in moisture level by the vegetation. Thus, the highest lost of moisture by 
                        vegetation occurred at areas with -0.4 NDMI change and the highest gain in moisture by 
                        vegetation occurred in areas with 0.3 NDMI change. With such a short timelaspe between 
                        images and relatively limited range of change, the proposed most plausible
                        cause of change in NDMI is seasonal changes where April image is under the Spring weather
                        condition which changes to Autumn for the October image. The spatial distribution of changes 
                        in NDMI is such that moderate loss in moisture (-0.2 to 0.0) occurs more extensively in the 
                        south western part of the study area and much lesser in the south eastern part. Further, 
                        greater area of vegetation in the western part of the central belt of the study area had 
                        an increase in its moisture content (0 to 0.3 NDMI change). Differences in the amount of
                        moisture lost or gain is likely to be contributed by the varying forest and vegetation on 
                        the landscape ranging from broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest to mixed forest 
                        as verified from 2018 CORINE land cover.

            <h3>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Multi-temporal composite analysis with SNAP </h3>
            <div>
                <p> 
                    Multitemporal composite analysis involves combining images of different timestep to detect 
                    changes evident in a study area over time period under study. This analysis is quite simple 
                    and efficient in depicting both unchanged and change areas of phenomena being studied. 
                    In this tutorial, we undertake multi-temporal composite analysis with the SNAP tool. 
                    As part of the exercise, we will design a typical workflow for undertaking a multi-temporal 
                    composite analysis, view important metadata characteristics of the satellite image, image 
                    preprocessing, analysis, and presenting map output as well as interpreting them. So by the 
                    end of this tutorial, we will be achieving these objective;
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Undertake image calibration, speckle filtering, terrain correction and image stacking
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Undertake a SAR multi-temporal composite analysis
                        </li>
                    </ul>                  
                </p>

                    Before proceeding with the analysis, we will be in a better position now if you have an idea of the
                    processing chain will pass through to produce our Multi-temporal composite <i>a.k.a <em>workflow</em></i>

                <h4>Image acquisition of Sentinel 1 images</h4>
                <p>We will be using radar images from Sentinel 1 for the analysis. We will use three images of different time
                    steps of the same study area which will be the region of Mekong Delta. These images not only reflects 
                    different conditions of the study area at different times but also different
                    land use activities in the area. In order to capture the phenomena we are analyzing very well,
                    particualr attention will be paid to time period the image covers and for this we need some
                    background knowledge of the study area. We will consider time periods where different land use 
                    activities are dominant. So, the selection of dates for the image will be based on the supposed
                    periods for land preparation, planting and harvesting of rice in certain towns such as Mua. Clearly,
                    these are activities will produce significant changes on the landscape that can be captured.
                    We also have to take note that different towns undertake different activities at different times. 
                    The main phenomena that is being researched with the multitemporal composite analysis is land use 
                    changes depicting the growth stage of rice cultivation in the Mekong Delta region. With this 
                    understanding, we can now proceed to focus on the images to be used.
                    

                </p>
                <p>
                    The image used for this analysis is a radar sensed image being sentinel 1 Ground Range Detector in 
                    Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode. Three timesteps being 13th March 2018, 16th 
                    August 2018 and 7th January 2019 image covering the Mekong delta were download from Copernicus 
                    Access Hub. You can use these specifications to download the same images if you want have the
                    same results that we have produced here. We start by displaying the first timestep image of 13th
                     March 2018 in the Amplitude band in VH polarization. The result is displayed below;

                <h4>Preprocessing analysis of Sentinel 1 images</h4>
                <p>Preprocessing of the image began with image calibration which was done to convert pixel values of
                    image to correspond with backscatter of the surface. For this exercise, the importance of calibration
                    lies in comparing images of different times. Also, Speckle filtering was undertaken to improve image
                    interpretation and visualization. Speckle is a “salt and pepper” effect inherent in radar images
                    (Held et al, 2003). Further, terrain correction was undertaken to correct geometric distortions. These
                    preprocessing analysis were repeated for all images of different timesteps. Prior to Multitemporal
                    composite analysis of image, the preprocessed images were converted to decibels in logarithmic
                    scale to improve visualization and stacked together.

                <h3>Preprocessing of image</h3>
                <p>Now, we can start with the preprocessing of the images. This will be done with SNAP with 
                    instructions. We will process the first image and the rest of the images can process with 
                    the same method as a form of practice. All images have to be processed for the composite
                    analysis. Let start the preprocessing with image calibration.

                    Radiometric then click on Calibrate button. From the Calibration box that opened, select 
                    image to be calibrated in the Source product box. Click on Processing parameters button, and set
                    the preferred processing parameter as Output sigma0 band. Click on Run button to execute
                    calibration. We will notice that the surfix ‘Cal’ is added to the name of the product for saving 
                    in the Target product and can be rename as preferred. You can also follow the procedure 
                    which is visualized in the figure below.

                    Speckle are salt grain-like noise on the image and has to be removed. To do so,
                    we will click on Radar button from the menu bar and navigate to speckle filtering then click
                     on Single Product speckle filter. From the dialog box of Single Product speckle filter, we have to 
                     set the appropriate Input / Output parameters. For Source product, we will select the calibrated image 
                     and provide a name for the Target Product. Now we have to choose the filter type that should be used.
                     To do that, click on Processing Parameters button and select Lee as the preferred filter. Finally, click on
                     Run button to execute speckle filtering. The workflow is visualized below

                    Proceeding from that, we navigate to Geometric button followed by Terrain correction and then 
                    click on Range Doppler Terrain correction. From the dialog box of Range Doppler Terrain Correction, 
                    we will select the calibrated and speckle filtered image from the previous preprocessing result 
                    as the Source Product. We will leave all the Processing Parameters as default and click

                        We have successfully completed preprocessing of the sentinel 1 radar image of the first 
                        timestep. The second and third timestep image which were sensed on 16th August 2018 and 7th January 2019 
                        respectively will also need to be preprocessed using the same procedure discussed for the first
                        timestep image. The most important issue is that they all cover the same study area for them to be
                        comparable. For that reason, we will not repeat the preprocessing of the rest of the images but will

                                no classification is required to interpret the various land cover and land use hence no legend was
                                created for the map in that regard.

                                    The multitemporal colour composite of images covering the time periods of 13th 
                                    March 2018, 16th April 2018 and 7th January 2019 created depicts changes in the backscattering coefficients of land
                                    cover and land use such as rice cultivation in the region of Mekong delta. The time-steps indicates
                                    the rice growing seasons including harvesting which varies across the Mekong delta. Corresponding
                                    to the chosen dates, Mua which is a rice growing community in Mekong undertakes planting in
                                    August and harvesting in January (Liew et al, 1997). The map of multitemporal composite illustrates large 
                                    variation in colour which corresponds to the large variety of rice cropping system, different growing 
                                    season and variety of rice planted in the Mekong delta region as argued by Xuan (1975) and Liew et al, (1997). 
                                    The grey areas indicate unchanged areas over the time covered with relatively constant backscattering coefficient. 
                                    These areas are expected to be non-rice growing areas with relatively more permanent land cover during
                                    the timesteps considered. Such areas include inland melaleuca forests, the coastal mangrove forests
                                    where there is no significant change in the land cover compared to rice cultivation fields that have
                                    changed with farming activities within the short period studied. Grey areas which appear to be linear
                                    are linear settlements and roads which had relatively constant backscattering during the period (Liew
                                    et al, 1997).
