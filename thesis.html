            <h2>Multidimensional Assessment of Ecosystem Services: Using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) for ecosystem service assessment in France</h2>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                The development and exploitation of ecosystem services such as food, 
                timber, genetic resources, nutrient cycling, water regulation, ecotourism and 
                recreation among others have largely occurred as social interaction with ecosystems; 
                for which its consequence have been assessed. In fact, 60% of global ecosystem services 
                have degraded with scientific consensus noted among several researches including the 
                Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 
                Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Yet to be adequately understood are the questions 
                of “how much ecosystem service hotspots are left?” and “where are they located for 
                proper management and planning?” This among other enquiry ignited the research interest 
                of this thesis; which is also given impetus by the need to resolve numerous 
                methodological flaws in existing researches such as the limitations in the use of 
                Costanza co-efficient and the need to compile and synchronize existing conceptual 
                frameworks with relevant decision aid tools such as the sustainability framework.
            </p>

            <div>
                
                <p> Informed by this, this thesis seeks to undertake multidimensional 
                    assessment of ecosystem services with Multicriteria Decision Aid to 
                    identify distribution of ecosystem service hotspots among others under 
                    various scenarios of prioritization in a spatially explicit manner. To 
                    achieve this, the distribution of ecosystem services were mapped, 
                    hypothesis of spatial clustering of ecosystem services was tested, 
                    the relationship between various ecosystem services was investigated, 
                    ecosystem service hotspots under various prioritization was assessed and 
                    their percentage share in various regions also analyzed to offer an ecosystem 
                    service perspective in regional planning. The task was addressed by reviewing 
                    major ecosystem service conceptual frameworks to explore their utility and 
                    resolve their weakness for the benefit of this thesis. Moreover, all ecosystem 
                    services identified were compiled, selection of indicators was structured and 
                    based on the criteria of ability to communicate information to policy makers 
                    and availability of spatial datasets.
                </p>
                
            </div>
  
            <div>
            
                <p>
                    To operationalize and contextualize the assessment, Metropolitan France 
                    was used as an analytical unit base on explicit call for ecosystem 
                    service perspective for regional development planning and management in 
                    the country. ArcGIS, Quantum GIS (GIS), matplotlib (python library) and 
                    PowerBI were employed as tools for analysis and data visualization. The 
                    analysis undertaken involved various preprocessing techniques, 
                    aggregation of criteria maps, spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran`s I), 
                    hotspot analysis, weighted sum overlay and zonal statistics.
                </p>
            </div>    
        </div>

        <div>
            
            <p>

                Deduced from the assessment, ecosystem services are spatially clustered hence 
                an evidence to underscore the importance of regional analysis and planning of 
                ecosystem services is provided in this research. Economic and ecological ecosystem 
                services were assessed to be positively related hence a synergy is realized. Opposed 
                to this, is a negative relationship between social ecosystem services and all other 
                ecosystem services hence a trade-off. The novelty of this research lies in its ability 
                to capture various scenarios of prioritizing different ecosystem services 
                while capturing the resulting variations in the distribution of ecosystem 
                service hotspots. For this, prioritization of economic ecosystem services 
                produces the largest distribution of ecosystem service hotspots covering 
                6.43% of France landscape hence the best bet to be explored among other 
                potential policy pathways. As a caution, prioritization of social ecosystem 
                services will produce the least distribution of ecosystem service hotspots 
                covering 3.13% of France landscape. While this research provided numerous 
                insights in the field of ecosystem service assessment, it remains acquiescent and 
                inspirational for other researches in the field hence not reaching a dead end. Thus, 
                this thesis subject itself to other MCDA techniques as an object of further enquiry and 
                spatio-temporal assessment of ecosystem service hotspots will be an added value.
